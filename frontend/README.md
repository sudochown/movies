This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About Movies App

The application consists of three pages - a registration/authorization page, a page with a list of films, and a page about the film.

When you first load the application, you can register and then log in, and then you will be automatically redirected to the movie page.
The authorization steps are intuitively clear.

Filtering and sorting of films is implemented on the page with films. By clicking on the name of the film, you will be redirected to a page with a detailed description of it.

If you want to log out or change your account, in the header you can click on the profile and log out.
